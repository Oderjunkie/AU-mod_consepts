### New consepts
This catagory includes incorperating third-party software directly into among us to bypass the need for it.<br/>
There aren't any rules for this catagory.
### New roles
There are two types of new roles:
#### New base roles
These are roles that have a completely seperate win condition, "Jester" is a good example.<br/>
Try to make sure that these roles directly compete with the other base roles.
#### Altered roles
These are roles that take a base role, and modify it slightly, "Mechanic" and "Saboteur" are the most common, they're modifications of "Crewmate" and "Imposter" respectively.<br/>
Try to keep alterations balanced for the most part, if you add a feature, take a different one away, for example:<br/>
Escapist is an alteration of Imposter, it changes:<br/>
\+ You can hide bodies in vents<br/>
\+ You can push bodies around in vents<br/>
\- Bodies can be reported while you're carrying them.<br/>
\- Vents with bodies in them become unusable for Imposters.
